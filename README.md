# Xiaomi Xiao Ai Touchscreen Speaker (LX04) to Xiaomi Mi Smart Clock (X04G) findings

I will be posting my notes here, as well as what I discover during the process of porting the 
firmware from the Chinese version to the global one. 

I have managed to do this now; the only thing left is to update the serial number to match the sticker.
